        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">This invention has been out for nearly two years. We got the sniff of this only
            recently through a state media channel - Asianet News. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The video is in the Malayalam language. Many other videos are available, but they
            are
            either too short, or they are interviews. Hence we have had to translate the content here. It is somewhat
            abridged, but the main theme is preserved. The translated video title comes out to be: Don&rsquo;t burn
            coconut leaves and discard; it is money</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Traditionally most coconut farmers and harvesters sell their fruits and related
            products in various parts of Kerala/Tamil Nadu/Maharasthra. The usual business ends with this distribution
            to the end-industries. The by-products of harvesting such the leaves of the tree, fruit husks, shells, etc,
            are normally considered as waste - they are commonly burned or repurposed for other trivial purposes.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Thanks to Dr. Saji Varghese, a professor of English literature of Christ
            University
            (Bangalore), there is a way to make straws out of the leaves of the coconut tree. These straws are also
            biodegradable. This invention comes during a time where the use of plastic and its harmful impacts are only
            being slowly recognized by the states and its citizens. Hence it is a welcome initiative.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Many plants have some wax-like substance in them; it gets created as part of
            their
            normal metabolism. Mr Varghese says his initial inspiration came when he saw the coconut leaves curled up in
            his yard. Later he experimented with boiling them and rolling them, until he could obtain the shape of the
            straw. Today Saji Varghese has patented the manufacturing process, and, has currently orders worth 10 crore
            rupees from few countries around the world. He has employed many women in various villages in Karnataka.
            There is currently production of about 3 million straws per week.</span></p>
